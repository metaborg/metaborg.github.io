# Spoofax 2.5.22 (30-07-2024)

Spoofax 2.5.22 removes all `javax.inject` annotations from the codebase, only `jakarta.inject` annotations remain.

This change only impacts users that distribute Java projects that depend on parts of Spoofax. Spoofax code will no longer work with `guice` version 5.1.0 due to this change, but _will_ now work with `guice` version 6.0.0 since that version will no longer complain about double-annotated arguments. Spoofax itself uses `guice` version 7.0.0 (changed in the [previous release](2.5.21.md)) which ignores `javax.inject` annotations and only looks for `jakarta.inject` annotations.

## Changes

- Removed all `javax.inject` annotations from the codebase, only `jakarta.inject` annotations remain.

### Dependencies

- Removed `java.inject:java.inject:1` as a direct dependency.
