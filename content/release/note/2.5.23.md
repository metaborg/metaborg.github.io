# Spoofax vNext

Spoofax 2.5.22 is a small release that adds additional options for defining concrete object syntax for Stratego 2. Stratego 2 code generation is also adapted in preparation for experiments to improve performance.

## Changes

- Stratego 2 now accepts constructors that start with `StrategoToMetaExpr`/`StrategoToTerm`/`StrategoMetaVar` in concrete object syntax.
- Stratego 2 now generates static `callStatic` methods in `Strategy` class objects, and calls those in the `invoke` method. In the future, we will test an optimisation where static strategy calls in Stratego code are translated to static method calls on the JVM.
