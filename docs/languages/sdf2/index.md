# SDF2 Syntax Definition Formalism
SDF2 is the Syntax Definition Formalism meta-language in Spoofax for defining the syntax of a language, and the successor of the ASF+SDF Algebraic Specification Formalism and Syntax Definition Formalism meta-languages. SDF2 is used for both parsing an input into an Abstract Syntax Tree, and to provide syntax highlighting.
