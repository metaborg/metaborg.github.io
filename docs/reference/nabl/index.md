# NaBL - Name Binding Language

## Background
The NaBL[@KonatKWV12] language provides support for the declaration of the name binding rules of programming languages in terms of _definitions_, _references_, and _scoping_.

The NaBL _task engine_ supports incremental execution of type checkers based on NaBL[@WachsmuthKVGV13]. While the paper used the WebDSL language as example, the NaBL analysis was only applied in production in the SDF3 language.

The NaBL language is very declarative, but binding patterns such as sequential let and 'subsequent scope' are difficult to express in it.
